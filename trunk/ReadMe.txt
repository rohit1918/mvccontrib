We have found CodePlex and Google Code source control to be inadequate for this project; therefore, we have created a GIT trunk on GitHub.com for source code hosting.

http://github.com/mvccontrib/MvcContrib/tree/master

For a tutorial on how to use GIT and contribute to the mvccontrib project please view this guide: http://mvccontrib.github.com/MvcContrib/

We will use CodePlex to host the project; however, because we feel the features on CodePlex are slightly superior to the experience at Github.com.

For most people, you will need to log into CodePlex to submit and vote on issues.  You'll check out the source trunk with the git url above and then submit patches through CodePlex.  Only full-time committers will need to maintain a google account.
